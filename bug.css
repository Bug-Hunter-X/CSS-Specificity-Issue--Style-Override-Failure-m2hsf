The CSS specificity is too low to override the style. This happens when you have multiple CSS rules that apply to the same HTML element, but one rule has higher specificity than the other. Specificity is determined by a number of factors, including the element's type, its class, and its ID. For example, an ID selector has higher specificity than a class selector, and a class selector has higher specificity than an element selector.
